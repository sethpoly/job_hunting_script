# job_hunting_script
A python script which opens up all the necessary wesbites and files that I use when starting a job application session.

## Websites and files opened
- Various job boards (LinkedIn jobs, Indeed, etc.)
- Google spreadsheet to keep track of all jobs applied to
- Current resume
- Github account

## Reasons for creation
I needed a way to quickly open up all the resources needed to start applying for jobs. Hopefully I won't need to use this script for much longer.
